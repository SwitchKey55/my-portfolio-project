            log_error(e)In this code, we assume you have implemented the following functions:

get_failed_transactions(): Retrieves a list of failed transactions from a database or storage.
log_successful_resubmission(tx_hash): Logs the successful resubmission of a transaction by storing the transaction hash.
remove_failed_transaction(tx): Removes the transaction from the failed transactions list.
log_error(e): Logs any exceptions that occur during the transaction resubmission process.
